Let your smile change the world, but do not let the world change your smile 

In something as small as a tear, drop something as big as a feeling 

Everyone sees what you appear, but few see what you really are 

A friend comes early, others when they have time 

When you lose, do not look at what you lost, but what's left to win 

I love you not only as you are, but as I am when I'm with you 

Do not be afraid to take a big step ... A precipice hopping is not passed
